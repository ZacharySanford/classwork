        <h3> My Hometown </h3>
        <p>
            I grew up in St. Johns which got it's
            name from John's Station which was shortened
            to John's St. It was at one point the mint
            growing capital of the world. Because of
            this they also had Shamrock Shakes longer
            than other places and that makes it pretty
            much the coolest place ever.

        <p>
            I am currently enrolled in Grand Circus for C#/.Net & Java.
            I am going to be digging into Playwright for my current employment
            to help build automated test suites for our services. I have also
            completed an online bootcamp course through Udemy for PostgreSQL.

            To catch them is my real test
            To train them is my cause
            I will travel across the land
            Searching far and wide
